## 🎯 What Is a CS2 Skin Changer?

A **skin changer** is a memory-level cheat that modifies how weapon skins, gloves, agents, and other cosmetics appear in-game—**only for your view**, but with full animations and textures. These changes are client-side, so they’re safe for offline, demos, or casual server use.

You won’t get the real market item—but you’ll look like you *own the server.*
